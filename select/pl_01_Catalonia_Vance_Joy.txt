Hey Catalonia,
I was just getting to know ya
When you stumble down
those streets tonight
Just know you'll be on my mind
You'll be on my mind
The streets still radiate
with heat
We hang onto the summer
Pour me a tall dry vermouth
and take me undercover
Spend another night with you
in our sweet disorder
The seaside always fills the air
all through the gothic quarter
Oh,
somehow I got to walk you home
And oh,
I guess I forgot to take it slow
Oh, you take me places
I can't go alone
Alone
Hey Catalonia,
I can hear you across the ocean
All the stories
that we left behind,
I trust you're my alibi
Hey Catalonia,
I was just getting to know ya
When you stumble down
those streets tonight
Just know you'll be on my mind
You'll be on my mind
Across the square,
we hear the bells
Toll midnight in the Churches
Another stroll to nowhere,
under olive trees and arches
Climb up to your terrace,
look out over the rooftops
Intoxicating moments,
in the moment so lost
Oh,
somehow I got to walk you home
And oh,
I guess I forgot to take it slow
Oh, you take me places
I can't go alone
Alone
Hey Catalonia,
I can hear you across the ocean
All the stories
that we left behind,
I trust you're my alibi
Hey Catalonia,
I was just getting to know ya
When you stumble down
those streets tonight
Just know you'll be on my mind
You'll be on my mind
On my mind
On my mind
Oh, you take me places
I can't go alone
Alone
Hey Catalonia,
I can hear you across the ocean
All the stories
that we left behind,
I trust you're my alibi
Hey Catalonia,
I was just getting to know ya
When you stumble down
those streets tonight
Just know you'll be on my mind
You'll be on my mind.
On my mind
On my mind
