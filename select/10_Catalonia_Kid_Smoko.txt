(Oh hold up, let me go)

Catatonic states become too familiar
Catalonian breeze might take me under (me under)
Oh, feelin' so divine, it takes my will away
Oh, it's reelin' me inside, calming thoughts keep me at bay, I thought

Separation is a bitch you know (you know)
I been waiting on my afterglow, really though (afterglow)
I been folded like a centerfold (centerfold)
Take a memory of that pedestal, really though (though)
If I get over myself, would you give me your type?
When I saw you I felt like I'm passing my prime
Pass a text and then declare that you're the masochist
Fake success and find material in the abyss

I can't get no fucking peace of mind (peace of mind)
Yeah
It feels like I'm losing my damn mind, all the time (all the time)
Yeah
It's like will I live or will I die
Yeah
All I know I need you by my side, all the time
Ey, got some drugs in my pocket, have a hell of a night
Yeah, we fucking or stopping, I asked though I was polite
They say I gotta keep digging, keep digging
I got a secret that I won't tell nobody
I got drugs in my body
Yeah, they help me forget
But, they're short-term
Ey lady, I been depressed, I made the wrong turn
Ey, you said you were distressed, but I'm in my world
Ey, yeah I'm a bad boy
Ey, but you a bad girl, uh

Catatonic states become too familiar
Catalonian breeze might take me under (me under)
Oh, feelin' so divine, it takes my will away
Oh, it's reelin' me inside, calming thoughts keep me at bay, I thought

Though it's nights like this
I wish I could come back to return no place
I don't feel it that much even though they're the same
I got the whole damn world at my fingertips
Ey
