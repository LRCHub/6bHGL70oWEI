[00:00.33] Hey Catalonia, I was just gettin' to know ya
[00:04.46] When you stumble down those streets tonight
[00:07.16] Just know you'll be on my mind
[00:12.81] You'll be on my mind
[00:22.81] 
[00:19.40] The streets still radiate with heat, we hang onto the summer
[00:24.13] Pour me a tall dry Vermouth, and take me undercover
[00:28.92] Spend another night with you in our sweet disorder
[00:33.57] The seaside always fills the air all through the Gothic Quarter
[01:05.07] 
[00:38.63] Oh, somehow I got to walk you home
[00:42.13] And, oh, I guess I forgot to take it slow
[00:48.24] Oh, you take me places I can't go alone, alone
[01:11.24] 
[00:57.83] Hey Catalonia, I can hear you across the ocean
[01:02.09] All the storiеs that we left behind, I trust you'rе my alibi
[01:07.40] Hey Catalonia, I was just gettin' to know ya
[01:11.59] When you stumble down those streets tonight
[01:14.36] Just know you'll be on my mind
[01:29.36] 
[01:20.27] You'll be on my mind
[01:30.27] 
[01:26.63] Across the square, we hear the bells
[01:28.84] Toll midnight in the churches
[01:31.24] Another stroll to nowhere, under olive trees and arches
[01:36.32] Climb up to your terrace, look out over the rooftops
[01:40.87] Intoxicating moments, in the moment so lost
[02:02.37] 
[01:45.88] Oh, somehow I got to walk you home
[01:50.10] And, oh, I guess I forgot to take it slow
[01:55.44] Oh, you take me places I can't go alone, alone
[02:18.44] 
[02:05.00] Hey Catalonia, I can hear you across the ocean
[02:09.27] All the stories that we left behind, I trust you're my alibi
[02:14.56] Hey Catalonia, I was just gettin' to know ya
[02:18.97] When you stumble down those streets tonight
[02:21.77] Just know you'll be on my mind
[02:36.77] 
[02:27.44] You'll be on my mind
[02:32.60] On my mind
[02:37.43] On my mind
[02:42.43] 
[02:43.60] Oh, you take me places I can't go alone, alone
[03:06.60] 
[02:53.02] Hey Catalonia, I can hear you across the ocean
[02:57.43] All the stories that we left behind, I trust you're my alibi
[03:02.64] Hey Catalonia, I was just gettin' to know ya
[03:07.04] When you stumble down those streets tonight
[03:09.61] Just know you'll be on my mind
[03:24.61] 
[03:15.26] You'll be on my mind
[03:20.78] On my mind
[03:25.36] On my mind
